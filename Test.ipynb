It’s also a bit of a scary time because customers expect a lot more from their brands than they did in the past. During this incredibly necessary and overdue social reckoning that we’re having in our culture, it is no longer acceptable for brands to stay out of the conversation. Consumers want to know, “Are you willing to use your brand awareness to effect positive social change?” Which will create more brand awareness. The question I ask the brands I work with is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is… “Are you gonna be on the right side of history?”',\n",

Um, I’ve been working for the last couple months, um, testing this camera, and testing lights, and writing, and I’ve decided to, uh, try to make a new special. For real. Um, it’s not gonna be a normal special because there’s no audience, and there’s no crew. It’s just me and my camera, and you and your screen. Uh, the way that… that our Lord intended.

I… I hope this special can maybe do for you what it’s done for me these last couple months, which is, uh, to distract me from wanting to put a bullet into my head with a gun. So… Yeah, thank you.

It’s also a bit of a scary time because customers expect a lot more from their brands than they did in the past.

Consumers want to know, “Are you willing to use your brand awareness to effect positive social change?” Which will create more brand awareness.

Welcome to, uh, whatever this is. Um, I’ve been working for the last couple months, um, testing this camera, and testing lights, and writing, and I’ve decided to, uh, try to make a new special. For real. Um, it’s not gonna be a normal special because there’s no audience, and there’s no crew. It’s just me and my camera, and you and your screen. Uh, the way that… that our Lord intended. Um… And the whole special will be… will be filmed in this, uh, room. And instead of being filmed in a single night, it will be filmed in uh, however long it takes to finish. I hope you, uh, enjoy it. I… I hope this special can maybe do for you what it’s done for me these last couple months, which is, uh, to distract me from wanting to put a bullet into my head with a gun. So… Yeah, thank you. And a warning.

Hello, my name is Bo Burnham. And I am a former comedian, turned social brand consultant. It’s a very exciting time to be a, uh, brand. It’s also a bit of a scary time because customers expect a lot more from their brands than they did in the past. During this incredibly necessary and overdue social reckoning that we’re having in our culture, it is no longer acceptable for brands to stay out of the conversation. Consumers want to know, “Are you willing to use your brand awareness to effect positive social change?” Which will create more brand awareness. The question I ask the brands I work with is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is… “Are you gonna be on the right side of history?” The question isn’t, “What are you selling?” Or… or “What service are you providing?” The question is, “What do you stand for?” Who are you,\\xa0Bagel Bites? All these big companies, they’re so scared of all this social change, and I come in and I put their fears to rest. You know, I tell them, “Just be honest.Tell your customers that… that JPMorgan is against racism.” In theory. The question is no longer, “Do you want to buy Wheat Thins?” For example. The question is now, “Will you support Wheat Thins in the fight against Lyme disease?” There’s no sugarcoating it. The world is… fucked up. And you’ve got a choice as a brand. You can… hide and bury your head in the sand and hope it fixes itself, or you can roll up your sleeves and get to work, and sell Butterfingers. ♪ An open window\\xa0♪ ♪ A novel\\xa0♪ ♪ A couple holding hands\\xa0♪ ♪ An avocado\\xa0♪ ♪ A poem\\xa0♪ ♪ Written in the sand\\xa0♪ ♪ Fresh fallen snow on the ground\\xa0♪ ♪ A golden retriever in a flower crown\\xa0♪ ♪ Is this heaven\\xa0♪ ♪ Or is it just a white woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ Latte foam art\\xa0♪ ♪ Tiny pumpkins\\xa0♪ ♪ Fuzzy, comfy socks\\xa0♪ ♪ Coffee table made out of driftwood\\xa0♪ ♪ A bobblehead of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\xa0♪ ♪ A needlepoint of a fox\\xa0♪ ♪ Some random quote From Lord of the Rings ♪ ♪ Incorrectly attributed To Martin Luther King\\xa0♪ ♪ Is this heaven\\xa0♪ ♪ Or am I looking at a white woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ Her favorite photo of her mom\\xa0♪ ♪ The caption says\\xa0♪ ♪ I can’t believe it\\xa0♪ ♪ It’s been a decade Since you’ve been gone ♪ ♪ Momma, I miss you\\xa0♪ ♪ I miss sitting with you In the front yard ♪ ♪ Still figuring out How to keep living without you\\xa0♪ ♪ It’s got a little better But it’s still hard\\xa0♪ ♪ Momma, I got a job I love And my own apartment ♪ ♪ Momma, I got a boyfriend And I’m crazy about him\\xa0♪ ♪ Your little girl didn’t do too bad\\xa0♪ ♪ Momma, I love you Give a hug and kiss to Dad\\xa0♪ ♪ A goat-cheese salad\\xa0♪ ♪ A backlit hammock\\xa0♪ ♪ A simple glass of wine\\xa0♪ ♪ Incredibly derivative Political street art ♪ ♪ A dreamcatcher Bought from Urban Outfitters\\xa0♪ ♪ A vintage neon sign\\xa0♪ ♪ Three little words, a couple of doves\\xa0♪ ♪ And a ring on her finger From the person that she loves\\xa0♪ ♪ Is this heaven\\xa0♪ ♪ Or is it just a white woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman ♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ ♪ White woman\\xa0♪ ♪ A white woman’s Instagram\\xa0♪ Here’s a question for you guys. Um… Is it… is it necessary? Is it necessary that every single person on this planet um, expresses every single opinion that they have on every single thing that occurs all at the same time? Is that… is that necessary? Um… Or to ask in a slightly different way, um, can… can anyone shut the fuck up? Can… can anyone, any… any… any one, any single one, can any one… shut the fuck up about anything– About any… any single thing? Can any single person shut the fuck up about any single thing for an hour? You know, is that… is that possible? And I know you’re thinking, “You’re not shutting the fuck up right now,” and that’s true, but… ♪ Who needs a coffee ‘Cause I’m doing a run ♪ ♪ I’m writing down the orders now For everyone\\xa0♪ ♪ The coffee is free, just like me\\xa0♪ ♪ I’m an unpaid intern\\xa0♪ ♪ Sorting papers, running around\\xa0♪ ♪ Sitting in the meeting I’m not making a sound\\xa0♪ ♪ Barely people, somehow legal\\xa0♪ ♪ Unpaid intern\\xa0♪ ♪ You work all day, go back to your dorm\\xa0♪ ♪ And since you can’t afford a mortgage You just torrent a porn\\xa0♪ ♪ ‘Cause you’re an intern\\xa0♪ ♪ Unpaid ♪ Hey, everybody. Um, I thought I’d do a reaction video to the song that you just saw me perform. Thought that might be fun. Um, so I got my laptop all set up. So I’m ready to go, and let’s go. ♪ Who needs a coffee ‘Cause I’m doing a run… ♪ I like this song. Um, so the idea with this song was basically that there’s so many songs in the past about… about working-class jobs, but not a lot about the labor exploitation of the modern world, so that was the idea here. ♪ Barely people, somehow legal… ♪ My beard is a little shorter in this video ’cause I filmed it a couple weeks ago. ♪ Go back to your dorm\\xa0♪ ♪ And since you can’t afford a mortgage You just…\\xa0♪ I think it holds up.

What… Um, so I got my… Because this video played after that. Right. So, and now… Right. Okay, so I’ll just keep reacting. So, this is me reacting to the song. Um… What I’m doing is I’m explaining what the song means. Um, and what it’s about. I’m being a little pretentious. It’s, uh… it’s an instinct I have where I need everything that I write to have some deeper meaning or something. But it’s a stupid song, and, uh, it doesn’t really mean anything, and, uh, it’s… it’s pretty unlikable that I… that I feel this need, this desperate need, to be seen as intelligent. And the video’s ending here, as you can see, and look, I’m very confused. See, I’m very, very confused. ‘Cause I’m staring at myself, I don’t know what I’m looking at, and I’m starting to catch up now, and realizing what’s going on. And, uh, yeah, now I’m deciding to react to the reaction to the video. So here, um, I’m reacting to my own reacting, and I’m criticizing my initial reaction for… for being pretentious, which is… which is honestly, it’s a… it’s a defense mechanism. I’m… I’m so worried that criticism will be levied against me that I levy it against myself before anyone else can. And I think that, “Oh, if I’m self-aware about being a douchebag, it’ll somehow make me less of a douchebag.” But it… but it doesn’t. Um, self-awareness does not absolve anybody of anything. Am I balding? This is really, really disturbing. I don’t like looking at myself like this, and I want… I want this to stop. Okay, I want this to stop. I’m… I’m stopping this. So, yeah, that was, uh, my reaction to the song, and I hope you enjoyed it. ♪ CEO, entrepreneur\\xa0♪ ♪ Born in\\xa01964\\xa0♪ ♪ Jeffrey\\xa0♪ ♪ Jeffrey Bezos\\xa0♪ ♪ CEO, entrepreneur\\xa0♪ ♪ Born in 1964\\xa0♪ ♪ Jeffrey\\xa0♪ ♪ Jeffrey Bezos\\xa0♪ ♪ Come on, Jeffrey, you can do it\\xa0♪ ♪ Pave the way, put your back into it\\xa0♪ ♪ Tell us why Show us how ♪ ♪ Look at where you came from Look at you now\\xa0♪ ♪ Zuckerberg and Gates and Buffet\\xa0♪ ♪ Amateurs can fucking suck it\\xa0♪ ♪ Fuck their wives, drink their blood\\xa0♪ ♪ Come on, Jeff, get ’em!\\xa0♪ I don’t know about you guys, but, um, you know, I’ve been thinking recently that… that you know, maybe, um, allowing giant digital media corporations to exploit the neurochemical drama of our children for profit… You know, maybe that was, uh… a bad call by us.

You don’t want to, because… There are people that love you… That’s not true necessarily, but there could be people that love you in the future, and just don’t. I’ve had people close to me kill themselves, and I’ll be honest with you, didn’t love it. Didn’t love that. So just don’t. But if I could kill myself for a year… If I can– I’d do it today. If I could kill myself today and be dead until like 18 months from now, um, I would do it, but alas… when you kill yourself, you’re dead forever, and we shouldn’t be dead forever yet. So let’s not.

Um… These are some pretty crazy times, but it’s nice during these crazy times that we can get together. We can laugh. You know? Um… I’ve learned something over this last year, which is pretty funny. Um, I’ve learned that real-world human-to-human tactile contact will kill you, and that all human interaction, whether it be social, political, spiritual, sexual, or interpersonal should be contained in the much more safe, much more real interior digital space. That the outside world, the non-digital world, is merely a theatrical space in which one stages and records content for the much more real, much more vital digital space. One should only engage with the outside world as one engages with a coal mine. Suit up, gather what is needed, and return to the surface. Um… And is it just me, or do pirates need to take a little bit better care of their fuckin’ maps? You know, when I find a pirate’s map, it’s… it’s always tea-stained, and the edges are burnt, and it’s like if you’re a pirate, all right, and you’re gonna make this map and expect me to carry it around the globe as I search for your treasure, then laminate it. I can’t really, uh, play the guitar very well, um, or sing, so… You know, apologies. ♪ Stunning 8K resolution meditation app\\xa0♪ ♪ In honor of the revolution\\xa0♪ ♪ It’s half-off at the Gap\\xa0♪ ♪ Deadpool, self-awareness\\xa0♪ ♪ Loving parents, harmless fun\\xa0♪ ♪ The backlash to the backlash\\xa0♪ ♪ To the thing that’s just begun\\xa0♪ ♪ There it is\\xa0♪ ♪ Again\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ There it is\\xa0♪ ♪ Again\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ The surgeon general’s pop-up shop\\xa0♪ ♪ Robert Iger’s face\\xa0♪ ♪ Discount Etsy agitprop\\xa0♪ ♪ Bugle’s take on race\\xa0♪ ♪ Female Colonel Sanders\\xa0♪ ♪ Easy answers, civil war\\xa0♪ ♪ The whole world at your fingertips\\xa0♪ ♪ The ocean at your door\\xa0♪ ♪ The live-action Lion King\\xa0♪ ♪ The Pepsi halftime show\\xa0♪ ♪ Twenty thousand years of this\\xa0♪ ♪ Seven more to go\\xa0♪ ♪ Carpool Karaoke\\xa0♪ ♪ Steve Aoki, Logan Paul\\xa0♪ ♪ A gift shop at the gun range\\xa0♪ ♪ A mass shooting at the mall\\xa0♪ ♪ There it is\\xa0♪ ♪ Again\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ There it is\\xa0♪ ♪ Again\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ Reading Pornhub’s terms of service\\xa0♪ ♪ Going for a drive\\xa0♪ ♪ And obeying all the traffic laws\\xa0♪ ♪ In Grand Theft Auto 5\\xa0♪ ♪ Full agoraphobic\\xa0♪ ♪ Losing focus, cover blown\\xa0♪ ♪ A book on getting better\\xa0♪ ♪ Hand-delivered by a drone\\xa0♪ ♪ Total disassociation\\xa0♪ ♪ Fully out your mind\\xa0♪ ♪ Googling “derealization” ♪ ♪ Hating what you find\\xa0♪ ♪ That unapparent summer air\\xa0♪ ♪ In early fall\\xa0♪ ♪ The quiet comprehending\\xa0♪ ♪ Of the ending of it all\\xa0♪ ♪ There it is\\xa0♪ ♪ Again\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ There it is\\xa0♪ ♪ Again\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ That funny feeling\\xa0♪ ♪ Hey, what can ya say?\\xa0♪ ♪ We were overdue\\xa0♪ ♪ But it’ll be over soon\\xa0♪ ♪ You wait\\xa0♪ ♪ Hey, what can ya say?\\xa0♪ ♪ We were overdue\\xa0♪ ♪ But it’ll be over soon\\xa0♪ ♪ Just wait\\xa0♪ ♪ Hey, what can ya say?\\xa0♪ ♪ We were overdue\\xa0♪ ♪ But it’ll be over soon\\xa0♪ ♪ You wait\\xa0♪ ♪ Hey, what can ya say?\\xa0♪ ♪ We were overdue\\xa0♪ ♪ But it’ll be over soon\\xa0♪ ♪ You wait ♪ ♪ Hey, what can ya say?\\xa0♪ ♪ We were overdue\\xa0♪ ♪ But it’ll be over soon\\xa0♪ ♪ You wait\\xa0♪ So, I– Jesus.
